# Payment Gateway
A Payment Gateway is responsible for validating requests, storing card information and forwarding
payment requests and accepting payment responses to and from the acquiring bank.

This solution provides a Web API that exposes endpoints to allow users to simulate the above behaviours.
Transaction details are stored in a real database but the bank is simulated.
